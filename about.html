      <div class="about-content">
        <p>Clifton Valley Farms began with a simple dream: to bring locally-grown, high-quality blooms and plants to the River Falls community and surrounding businesses. Founded in 2023, we are a family-run operation dedicated to hands-on growing, sustainable practices, and friendly service.</p>

        <p>We believe that healthy plants start with a healthy environment, which is why every bloom in our greenhouse is tended to with meticulous care and responsible cultivation methods. When you purchase a plant from us, you're not just buying a product; you're supporting a local family and bringing a little piece of our passion into your home or business.</p>

        <p>Our commitment extends beyond our greenhouse walls. We strive to be an accessible resource for all gardeners, offering simple plant care advice and a welcoming atmosphere at our seasonal roadside stand.</p>

              <span class="role">Owner and Head Grower</span>
              <p>Anna’s lifelong love for gardening led her to establish Clifton Valley Farms. What started as a hobby greenhouse quickly grew into a commercial operation driven by the desire to share her carefully cultivated plants with a wider audience.</p>
              <p>With a degree in Horticulture and years of experience, Anna oversees every aspect of the farm, ensuring the Clifton Valley standard of excellence is met. Her favorite part of the job? Seeing a customer's face light up when they find the perfect plant.</p>
              <p>When she’s not in the greenhouse, Anna enjoys spending time with her family on the property, tending to her personal garden, and exploring the natural beauty of Western Wisconsin.</p>
